Populate_Table_Pega_Rules_Reference_Inheritance_Data.ipynb
populate_table_pega_rules_reference_inheritance_data.py
1.	Once the Acvtivity populates a json list of files for Application rules or Pega platform rules, the above collab does following steps
2.	Extracts the meaningful rule json based on context_rule_schema. Refer to data folder
3.	Insert that to Top_rules and reference rules table
4.	Initialize a LLM and send the meaningful Rule json to get its business description
5.	Get the Top down rule structure which can be sent to LLM too to get high level Business idea

This appproach is helpful to understand a traditional application and later the understanding can be seamlessly transferred to blueprint for rule creation
This approach can be used to understand the code in channels issue


Output of this is a sqllite rules.db having everything but business description

Now call samplerules.ipynb after passing the rules.db as input
It`s in Kaggle so for collab may need little modification such as input file and output file etc
once this notebook finishes, rulesdb top_rules table would be having business description.
