    "<p><strong>What privileges does the access group DecisionManager:Administrator have?</strong>This role is used in production where users need the ability to clean up adaptive monitoring data. This role comes with some responsibilities as they may significantly damage the production system.",
	"<p><strong>What privileges does the access group DecisionManager:DecisionArchitect have?</strong>This role is typically used in Business Sandbox environment, but it isapplicable in all environments and it should be restricted to Decisioning experts only. This role has full access to system capabilities.",
    "<p><strong>What privileges does the access group DecisionManager:RevisionManager have?</strong>This role is used in Business Sandbox environment. The role allows users to set up a new revision, create change requests, assign change requests to workbaskets and users, approve change requests and generate a revision package.",
    "<p><strong>What privileges does the access group DecisionManager:StrategyDesigner have?</strong>This role is used in Business Sandbox environment. The role allows working on change requests, change decision strategies, run simulations, test flows, submit changes for approval.",
    "<p><strong>What privileges does the access group DecisionManager:Supervisor have?</strong>This role is used in production environment where users need the ability to monitor the customer interactions and the performance of the adaptive models. With this role, users can not do any harm to the system, since they only have read-only capabilities.",
    "<p><strong>What role does Memory Size play in Trend detection?</strong>Typically, 3 adaptive models with different memory are used per proposition in trend detection. \n\nThe less memory, the faster the model will learn and change. This also means it is volatile. Faster models (less memory) are better short term while slow models (more memory) are better long term.",
