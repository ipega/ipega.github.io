below is a **clear, concrete explanation of what “Use Situational Layer Cake (SLC) in decisions, not Case Types” really means**, **why Pega recommends it**, and **how to implement it correctly for an EMEA-first, global CLM platform**.

---

# What the statement really means

> **SLC is meant to vary *behavior*, not *structure***

* **Case Types** define **structure**
  (stages, lifecycle, legal workflow)
* **Decisions** define **behavior**
  (rules, eligibility, KYC, approvals, SLAs)

So:

* **Do NOT layer Case Types by product/region**
* **DO layer decision rules by region/country/product**

---

# Wrong vs Right (very important)

## ❌ WRONG: SLC on Case Types

```
CLM-Work-Onboarding              (Base)
 ├─ CLM-Work-Onboarding-EMEA
 │    ├─ CLM-Work-Onboarding-DE
 │    ├─ CLM-Work-Onboarding-FR
 ├─ CLM-Work-Onboarding-APAC
```

### Why this fails

* Case Type explosion
* Structural changes propagate widely
* Heavy regression testing
* Poor App Studio transparency
* Hard to audit

---

## ✅ RIGHT: SLC on Decisions

```
CLM-Decision-KYCRequirements     (Base)
 ├─ EMEA
 │    ├─ Germany
 │    ├─ France
 ├─ APAC
 ├─ AMER
```

### Why this works

* Case Type remains stable
* Behavior varies cleanly
* Localized testing
* Clear audit trace

---

# How to implement SLC in decisions (step-by-step)

## 1️⃣ Stable global Case Type

```
CLM-Work-Onboarding
```

No region, no product logic here.

---

## 2️⃣ Context keys (facts, not classes)

Define **facts** used by decisions:

* `.Region` → EMEA / APAC / AMER
* `.Country`
* `.ProductCode`
* `.EntityType`
* `.RiskTier`

These are **data**, not class names.

---

## 3️⃣ Decision rule structure (example: KYC)

### Base decision

**Rule**: `CLM-Decision-KYCRequirements`

* Covers global minimum KYC

---

### EMEA layer

**Applies To**: same class
**Circumstance**: `.Region = "EMEA"`

Adds:

* EU AML rules
* GDPR-related constraints

---

### Country layer (Germany)

**Circumstance**:

```
.Region = "EMEA"
.Country = "DE"
```

Adds:

* German-specific documents
* Local regulator rules

---

### Product refinement (optional)

```
.ProductFamily = "CORP"
```

---

## 4️⃣ Decision execution (in flows)

In a **generic flow**:

```
Call CLM-Decision-KYCRequirements
→ returns list of required documents
```

Same flow for all regions.

# How SLC works with decisions (important distinction)

| SLC Element           | Case Type    | Decision     |
| --------------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Layered variation     | ❌ Structural | ✅ Behavioral |
| Frequency of change   | Rare         | Frequent     |
| Testing scope         | Wide         | Localized    |
| Audit clarity         | Low          | High         |
| App Studio visibility | Limited      | Clear        |

---

# Regulatory & audit advantage (why regulators prefer this)

Auditors ask:

> “Why did you request UBO document for this customer?”

With decision SLC:

* Decision trace shows:

  * Region = EMEA
  * Country = DE
  * Rule version
  * Outcome

With Case Type SLC:

* Must inspect inheritance chain
* Hard to prove determinism

---

# Testing model (your earlier concern addressed)

### Decision change (Germany KYC rule)

* Test:

  * `CLM-Decision-KYCRequirements_DE`
* No Case Type regression

### Case Type change (rare)

* Test once globally

---

# When (rarely) SLC on Case Types is acceptable

✔ Different **legal lifecycle**
✔ Different **regulatory process**
✔ Different **operating model**

Example:

```
CLM-Work-Onboarding
CLM-Work-Offboarding
```

Not:

```
CLM-Work-Onboarding-DE
CLM-Work-Onboarding-FR
```

---

# Final principle (memorize this)

> **Use Case Types to model “what must always happen”**
> **Use Decisions (with SLC) to model “what varies by region/product/risk”**

This is **exactly how Pega intends SLC to be used** in large, regulated platforms.

If you want next, I can:

* Provide a **full SLC decision hierarchy diagram**
* Show **actual Pega decision table examples**
* Design a **CLM decision catalog**
* Map this to **Pega guardrail wording**

Just tell me.
