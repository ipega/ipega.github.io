Got it — you are **designing for EMEA now, but the solution must be extensible to other regions (APAC, AMER) later**.
This is exactly where many CLM platforms fail, so let me extend the **four approaches with a regional lens** and then give you a **clear EMEA-first, global-ready recommendation**.

---

# Regional extensibility lens (EMEA → Global)

Key realities for CLM:

* EMEA ≠ APAC ≠ AMER
* Differences are mostly:

  * Regulatory rules
  * Data requirements
  * Approval thresholds
  * Screening intensity
* **Lifecycle is largely the same globally**

---

# 1️⃣ Case Type per Product (with regions)

### What it becomes with regions

```
CLM-Work-Onboarding-ProdA-EMEA
CLM-Work-Onboarding-ProdA-APAC
CLM-Work-Onboarding-ProdB-EMEA
...
```

### Regional impact

❌ Product × Region explosion
❌ Inheritance depth becomes unmanageable
❌ Regional regulatory changes require multiple CT edits
❌ Onboarding a new region is a *development project*

### Verdict

🚫 **Not viable beyond one region**

---

# 2️⃣ Circumstanced Case Types (Region + Product)

### What it becomes

```
CLM-Work-Onboarding
  Circumstance:
    Product = A
    Region = EMEA
```

### Regional impact

❌ Circumstance combinations explode
❌ Very hard to explain to regulators
❌ App Studio visibility is near zero
❌ Debugging cross-region issues is painful

### Verdict

🚫 **Worst option for multi-region CLM**

---

# 3️⃣ Single Case Type + Parent Flow + Regional/Product Subflows

### What it becomes

```
Parent Flow
 ├─ Flow-ProdA-EMEA
 ├─ Flow-ProdA-APAC
 ├─ Flow-ProdB-EMEA
```

### Regional impact

⚠ Flow explosion
⚠ Region logic buried in flows
⚠ Regulatory change → many flows updated
⚠ Testing across regions becomes heavy

### Verdict

🟡 **May work short-term for EMEA only**,
❌ **breaks when adding regions**

---

# 4️⃣ Single Case Type + Decision & Data-Driven (Region-aware) ✅

### What it becomes

```
ONE Case Type (Global)
Behavior driven by:
  - Region
  - Country
  - Regulator
  - Product
```

### Region is just DATA

```
Region = EMEA | APAC | AMER
```

No new Case Types. No new flows.

## How to model regions cleanly (EMEA-first, global-ready)

### 📘 Data Model (key)

#### `CLM_Product_Profile`

| Field          | Example      |
| -------------- | ------------ |
| ProductCode    | CORP_STD     |
| Region         | EMEA         |
| Country        | DE           |
| RiskModel      | EMEA_CORP_V1 |
| KYCProfile     | EMEA_STD     |
| ApprovalMatrix | EMEA_CORP    |
| FulfillmentSet | CORP_SET     |

---

### 🧠 Decision rules (SLC-friendly)

Use **Situational Layer Cake in decisions**, not Case Types:

```
CLM-Decision-KYC
  Base
   ├─ EMEA
       ├─ Germany
       ├─ France
   ├─ APAC
   ├─ AMER
```

This aligns **perfectly** with Pega guidance.

---

## Regulatory change example (realistic)

### Scenario

> EU updates UBO rules

### Decision-driven response

* Update EMEA layer of `CLM-Decision-KYC`
* No Case Type change
* No flow change
* No product redeployment

### Case-type-driven response

* Multiple CT updates
* Regression across products
* Long approval cycle

---

# Testing concern — revisited with regions

### ❓ “One Case Type means more testing across regions”

Actually:

* Case Type rarely changes
* Decisions are region-scoped
* Tests are **localized**

| Change              | Test scope               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| EMEA KYC rule       | EMEA decision tests only |
| New APAC region     | New data + decisions     |
| Global stage change | One Case Type test       |

---

# Recommended Global CLM architecture (EMEA first)

```
CLM-Work-Onboarding (Global)
  ├─ Generic Stages
  ├─ Generic Flows
  └─ Decisions layered by:
       Region
         └─ Country
             └─ Product Family
```

This gives you:
✔ EMEA compliance today
✔ APAC / AMER tomorrow
✔ Minimal rework
✔ Regulator-friendly traceability

---

# Final answer (clear)

> **For EMEA now and global later:**
>
> 🟢 **Single Case Type + Region-aware Decision & Data-Driven architecture**
>
> Use **SLC in decisions**, not in Case Types.

This is the **only model that scales cleanly across regions** without re-platforming.

If you want next, I can:

* Design a **region-country-product decision hierarchy**
* Provide **EMEA → APAC extension examples**
* Map this to **EU regulatory expectations**
* Show a **migration path from EMEA-only to global**

Just tell me.
